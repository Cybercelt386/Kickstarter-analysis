## Overview of Project
The purpose of this Analysis is to aid Louise in beginning her own Kickstarter company. Though our analysis she can see what types of Kickstarter companies were successful and where. The data is presented in such a way that one can filter out data such as country, goal, pledged amounts, types of businesses, and whether these campaigns were successful or not. Utilizing this data Louise can best chart the course of her own Kickstarter to achieve the optimal results.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
## Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis by organizing the data and formatting it to be more readable then I created pivot tables and graphs to provide a visual representation of the data I then filter the data according to Louise’s interests in this case theaters and plays I then sort out two different counties and compare how successful kickstarter’s in that country where for the theater business I then looked at the range of money that these kickstarter’s were asking for in their goal and whether or not they were successful. This should give Louise an idea of how much money she should ask for in her Kickstarter in order to have the highest chance of success.

This is my line chart showing the trends of kickstarter campains for the theater subcatagory in the united kingdom. As demontrated in the chart above the majority of campains were succsessful. I was challeged by the pivot table because I could not figure out how to configure the settings to break down the information by month rather than years or quartiles. I sought assistance from my classmates on slack and they told me the problem I was facing was the way exell automaticly added info to my chart based on its own suggestions and that I needed to remove these additions in order to make it work properly. A further chalage I faced was with the instructions for the COUNTIFS algorithm I found the information to be vague and confusing. I overcame this by looking up the COUNTIFS function on Youtube then cross referencing with class members on slack to ensure that I was properly understanding the task instructions.

## Results 
The result of my anayis show that if Louise wants to do a kicktarter theater production in the UK (GB) that her goal for her kickstarter should be within the 1000 t0 4999 range to ensure the best chance that her campain will be successfull. This data also shows that the majority of theater campains in the UK were succsessful. we can also tell that the month of may is the best time to launch her campian as the number of successful campains reaches its peak at this time.
