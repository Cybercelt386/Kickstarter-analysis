##Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis is to aid Louise in beginning her own Kickstarter company. Though our analysis she can see what types of Kickstarter companies were successful and where. The data is presented in such a way that one can filter out data such as country, goal, pledged amounts, types of businesses, and whether these campaigns were successful or not. Utilizing this data Louise can best chart the course of her own Kickstarter to achieve the optimal results.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
## Performance
I performed my analysis by organizing the data and formatting it to be more readable then I created pivot tables and graphs to provide a visual representation of the data I then filter the data according to Louise’s interests in this case theaters and plays I then sort out two different counties and compare how successful kickstarter’s in that country where for the theater business I then looked at the range of money that these kickstarter’s were asking for in their goal and whether or not they were successful. This should give Louise an idea of how much money she should ask for in her Kickstarter in order to have the highest chance of success.
